# Ontology of Continua — Core 1.2  
Axiomatically complete reference implementation of the OC framework

This repository hosts the canonical, deterministic, and fully reproducible
LaTeX environment for building the **Ontology of Continua — Core** whitepaper  
(**version 1.2**).

Core 1.2 is the first *axiomatically closed* and *mathematically complete*
release of the OC framework.  
It establishes the stable theoretical baseline for all future physics,
chemistry, biology, cognition and organisational extensions.

Everything required to build the PDF is contained inside this repository:

- `main.tex` — single master document  
- `preamble.tex` — global LaTeX configuration  
- modular content structure inside `content/`  
- YAML → Python → `_auto_core_inputs.tex` pipeline  
- GitHub Actions CI workflow  
- Zenodo metadata integration  
- CC BY 4.0 open-access license  

This repository is under **ARCHITECTURE FREEZE (Core 1.2)**.  
Only content files (`content/*.tex`) may change;  
pipeline, structure and LaTeX architecture are locked.

## 1. What’s new in Core 1.2

Core 1.2 extends the structural foundation introduced in Core 1.1 and turns it
into a fully closed formal theory. Key additions:

### **Axiomatics**
- complete axiom set covering  
  existence, admissible states, axes, potentials, flows, thresholds,  
  boundaries, cycles, continuumness, and evolution;  
- fully formalised dimensional transitions and death conditions.

### **Universal operators**
- the operator suite  
  **F, G, H, Q, R, S, U**  
  governing evolution of axes, potentials, thresholds, flows, boundaries,  
  cycles and complexity.

### **Theorem corpus**
- monotonicity of dimension  
- impossibility of spontaneous dimension creation  
- death through incompatibility with embedding space  
- universal law of complexity growth  
- structural landscape of admissible configurations

### **Complexity measure**
- formal definition of the OC complexity metric `S`  
- integration with operator `U`  
- relation to cycles, thresholds and Ω-geometry

### **Hierarchy K0–K12**
- full, vertically consistent continuum ladder  
- transitions, operators, thresholds, cycles, admissible state geometry  
- embedding spaces `M0 … M12`

### **Observed-universe module (TOE)**
- empirical constants  
- cosmological and field-theoretic parameters  
- mapping of physical reality to an OC continuum instance

## 2. PDF build

The PDF is built automatically on every push to `main`.

Output:

build/main.pdf 

CI workflow:

.github/workflows/build_pdf.yml


Download via:

GitHub → Actions → “Build Core PDF” → Artifacts → **OC-Core-1.2-PDF**

## 3. Local build instructions

Requirements:

- TeX Live 2023+ (xelatex + biber)
- latexmk (recommended)

### One-command build (recommended):

./build_core.sh

### Manual sequence:

latexmk -xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode
-output-directory=build main.tex

Cleanup:
latexmk -C -output-directory=build

## 4. Repository structure (short overview)

### Root:

- `main.tex` — master entry  
- `preamble.tex` — global configuration  
- `README.md` — this document  
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — repo structure specification  
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — naming/style rules  
- `BUILD_NOTES.md` — build system specification  
- `master_core_structure.yaml` — source of truth for content structure  
- `.zenodo.json` — metadata for DOI  
- `build_core.sh` — *only allowed* build entry  
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` — CI/CD

### Content (`content/`):

Core scientific text, including:

- `frontmatter.tex`  
- classical chapters (`01_intro.tex` … `06_conclusion.tex`)  
- extended chapters (`08_boundary.tex` … `16_modules_master.tex`)  
- new Core 1.2 modules:
  - `axioms_full.tex`
  - `operators_universal.tex`
  - `theorems_master.tex`
  - `complexity_S.tex`
- K-levels (`k_levels/`)
- M-spaces (`m_spaces/`)
- cross-level transitions (`crossk/`)
- cycles, experiments, falsifiability, predictions, processes
- TOE module: `content/toe/`

Automatically generated include list:

content/_auto_core_inputs.tex

Do not edit this file manually.

### Appendix:

- `A_notation.tex`
- `B_axioms_full.tex`
- `C_klevels_tables.tex`
- `toe_data.tex` (observed-universe constants)

### Figures:

Stored only in `figures/`.

## 5. Using this repository as a template

To create Core 1.3 or any extension (Physics Run, Chemistry Run, K-level expansions):

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Update `content/frontmatter.tex`.  
3. Add/modify scientific content inside `content/`.  
4. Place all figures in `figures/`.  
5. Add bibliography entries to `bib/references.bib`.  
6. If publishing separately, update `.zenodo.json`.  

### **Do not modify (frozen architecture):**

- `main.tex`  
- `preamble.tex`  
- YAML → auto-input pipeline  
- build scripts  
- CI workflows  

These components guarantee reproducibility and must remain unchanged.
