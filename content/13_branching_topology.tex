\section{Ontological Branching and Topology of Continuum Hierarchies}
\label{sec:branching-topology}

% TODO: migrate the material corresponding to the ontology of branches
% (Axiom 21 and related notes) into a consolidated section.
%
% Scope:
%   - Definition of ontological branches (K_0 -> K_X chains).
%   - Branching structure of continua and embedding spaces.
%   - Constraints on branching (numerical, structural, compatibility).
%
% Suggested internal structure:
%   1) Definition of ontological branches and branch spaces.
%   2) Branching vs linear hierarchies; conditions for bifurcation.
%   3) Numerical consistency along a branch (where already formulated).
%   4) Examples of candidate branches (physics, chemistry/biology, cognition).
%   5) Open questions on global topology of branches.
