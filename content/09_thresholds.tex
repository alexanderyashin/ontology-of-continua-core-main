% Dummy section recreated for Core 1.1 — extended threshold landscape

\section{Extended Threshold Landscape}
\label{sec:thresholds-extended}

% TODO: migrate and expand the full threshold taxonomy and landscape
% description from Core~1.0 / Core~2.x.
%
% Scope:
%   - Detailed classification of thresholds (existence, stability, critical,
%     dimensional, death, expressivity / embedding thresholds).
%   - Geometric / functional form of thresholds in representative cases.
%   - Examples of multi-threshold interactions and cascades.
%
% Suggested internal structure:
%   1) Recap of basic threshold types (Θ_exist, Θ_stab, Θ_crit, Θ_dim, Θ_death).
%   2) Composite thresholds and threshold landscapes.
%   3) Dimensional thresholds and conditions for axis birth.
%   4) Death thresholds and structural collapse.
%   5) Case studies across K_2–K_5 (e.g. BKT, RAF closure, protocell viability).
