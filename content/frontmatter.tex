\begin{abstract}
This document presents the consolidated \emph{Core~1.1} of the Ontology of Continua (OC), 
the first stable and vertically integrated release of the framework.  
Core~1.1 unifies and systematises all approved structural elements of OC into a coherent 
and reproducible reference, establishing the foundation for all future theoretical and 
domain-level developments.

The release integrates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the refined axiomatics of the substrate level \(K_0\), including structural 
          difference, the nonzero existence threshold \(\Theta_0\), and the absence of time;
    \item the generative operator \(\Psi_0\) and the construction of the first genuine 
          continuum \(K_1\);
    \item the universal definition of a continuum in terms of admissible states, axes, 
          potentials, flows, thresholds, boundaries, cycles, and continuumness;
    \item a unified taxonomy of thresholds 
          (\(\Theta_{\mathrm{exist}}, \Theta_{\mathrm{stab}}, \Theta_{\mathrm{crit}}, 
            \Theta_{\mathrm{dim}}, \Theta_{\mathrm{death}}\));
    \item the operators governing evolution, phase transitions, dimensional emergence, 
          and collapse;
    \item the structural theorems describing monotonicity of dimension, impossibility of 
          spontaneous dimension creation, irreversibility of death, and necessity of 
          compatibility with embedding spaces;
    \item a compact and consistent vertical hierarchy of continua from \(K_0\) to \(K_{10}\).
\end{itemize}

The goal of Core~1.1 is consolidation rather than expansion:  
to provide a stable LaTeX architecture, a clean file hierarchy, and a formally closed 
structural foundation onto which subsequent versions will add full proofs, domain-specific 
models, and empirical validation pipelines.  
Future releases (Core~1.2 and beyond) will extend the present foundation with detailed 
analytical derivations, quantitative dynamics, and applications across physics, chemistry, 
biology, cognition, social systems, and meta-theory.
