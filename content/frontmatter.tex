\begin{abstract}
This document presents the consolidated Core~1.1 of the Ontology of Continua (OC). 
It provides a stable and extensible LaTeX structure, a reproducible build pipeline, 
and a unified modular architecture for all future versions of the Core.  
Unlike earlier drafts, Core~1.1 integrates the complete foundational formalism of OC: 
the axioms of level \(K_0\), the construction of \(K_1\), the general continuum definition, 
the taxonomy of thresholds, the operators for potentials, flows and evolution, 
and the structural results governing birth, life and death of continua.  
The focus of this release is consolidation, coherence and vertical integration 
rather than domain-specific expansion.  
Future versions will extend the framework with full mathematical derivations, 
quantitative models, and empirical applications across physical, chemical, biological, 
cognitive, social and meta-theoretical domains.
