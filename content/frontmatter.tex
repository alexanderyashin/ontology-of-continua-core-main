\begin{abstract}
This document provides the publication shell for the Ontology of
Continua --- Core 1.1. Its primary purpose is to define a stable,
reproducible and extensible LaTeX infrastructure for the Core, rather
than to present the final scientific content of the theory.

The abstract is currently a placeholder and should be replaced by the
actual summary of the Ontology of Continua Core once the theoretical
material is fully integrated into this template.
