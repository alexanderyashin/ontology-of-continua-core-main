\subsection{Level \(K_3\): chemical continua and molecular organisation}
\label{subsec:toe-k3}

Level \(K_3\) introduces the class of chemical continua: systems in which
stable molecular configurations, reaction networks, and energy–matter
exchange mechanisms become well defined. While \(K_2\) supplies the
fields and parameters enabling atomic structure, \(K_3\) captures the
conditions under which chemically meaningful organisation emerges and
persists over time.

In the observed universe this corresponds to the domain where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item covalent, ionic and hydrogen bonds are stable within known
          thermodynamic ranges;
    \item reaction networks operate under identifiable kinetic laws;
    \item environmental potentials (temperature, pH, redox state,
          solvent polarity) remain within bounded regions;
    \item molecular diversity supports pathways that feed into 
          protometabolic organisation at \(K_4\).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The characteristic axes \(A^{(3)}\) include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{bond}}\): axes describing bond types and bond
          energies (\(E_{\mathrm{bond}}\));
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{conf}}\): configurational and conformational axes
          (rotational barriers, cis–trans states);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{env}}\): environmental axes (temperature, pH,
          redox potential, solvent parameters);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{kin}}\): kinetic axes governing reaction rates
          and activation barriers.
\end{enumerate}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(3)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{bond}}\): potential wells associated with chemical
          bonds, typically \(10^{-20}\)–\(10^{-18}\,\mathrm{J}\);
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{act}}\): activation potentials \(V^{\ddagger}\)
          determining reaction feasibility;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{env}}\): thermodynamic/environmental potentials
          (temperature, ionic strength, redox gradients);
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{conf}}\): torsional and conformational potentials.
\end{itemize}

These quantities correspond to measurable chemical parameters and are
documented in the extended data tables in 
Appendix~\ref{app:toe-constants-and-parameters}.

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

The admissible region \(\Omega(K_3)\) for the observed universe is 
delimited by thresholds \(\Theta^{(3)}\) ensuring that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item bond energies exceed thermal noise,
          \[
              E_{\mathrm{bond}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{bond}}
                  \sim k_{\mathrm{B}}T,
          \]
          yielding stable molecular structures;
    \item activation barriers satisfy
          \[
              V^{\ddagger} \geq \Theta_{\mathrm{act}},
          \]
          preventing uncontrolled degradation;
    \item environmental parameters lie within known chemical windows,
          \[
              T_{\min} < T < T_{\max}, \qquad
              \mathrm{pH}_{\min} < \mathrm{pH} < \mathrm{pH}_{\max},
          \]
          enabling reaction networks without collapse;
    \item redox potentials and solvent properties remain within bounds
          allowing the existence of hierarchical molecular ensembles.
\end{enumerate}

For the observed universe, empirical chemistry constrains these
thresholds tightly: liquid-water windows, redox ranges in natural
environments, and activation barriers for essential carbon chemistry.
These ranges coincide with those required for higher-level continua
\(K_4\) and \(K_5\).

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

Dominant flows \(J^{(3)}\) in chemical continua include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{react}}\): reaction flows converting reactants
          into products across activation barriers;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{diff}}\): diffusive transport regulating encounter
          rates between molecules;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{env}}\): environmental flows coupling temperature,
          redox and pH to chemical stability;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{energy}}\): energetic flows driving endergonic
          and exergonic processes.
\end{itemize}

Stabilising cycles \(C^{(3)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item reaction–transport cycles maintaining dynamic equilibrium;
    \item conformational cycles enabling adaptive molecular behaviour;
    \item environmental buffering cycles stabilising pH, redox and
          temperature windows.
\end{itemize}

Collapse modes at this level correspond to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(E_{\mathrm{bond}} \leq \Theta_{\mathrm{bond}}\): bond
          destabilisation and molecular degradation;
    \item \(T > T_{\max}\) or \(T < T_{\min}\): loss of chemical
          structure through thermal runaway or freezing;
    \item \(\mathrm{pH}\) or redox excursions that eliminate stable
          reaction networks;
    \item solvent collapse eliminating the configurational space needed
          for molecular organisation.
\end{enumerate}

Throughout the cosmological and planetary history accessible to us,
the observed universe remains well within \(\Omega(K_3)\), enabling the
transition to protometabolic organisation at level \(K_4\).
