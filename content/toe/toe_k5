\subsection{Level \(K_5\): excitable membranes and proto-neuronal continua}
\label{subsec:toe-k5}

Level \(K_5\) describes excitable biological continua: systems whose 
structure is maintained by ion gradients, membrane potentials and 
gated transport processes that allow the emergence of electrical 
excitability. While \(K_4\) establishes protocellular organisation with 
semi-permeable boundaries and metabolic cycles, \(K_5\) introduces the 
capacity for rapid, threshold-dependent state changes—an essential 
prerequisite for neural organisation at \(K_6\).

In the observed universe this corresponds to environments where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item lipid or similar membranes support stable ion gradients;
    \item selective channels and transporters enable voltage-dependent 
          or ligand-dependent fluxes;
    \item energetic processes (ATP-driven or analogous) maintain 
          electrochemical differentials;
    \item transient depolarisation events propagate through excitable 
          regions via coupled membrane dynamics.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The characteristic axes \(A^{(5)}\) include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{ion}}\): axes describing ionic species 
          (\(\mathrm{K}^+,\,\mathrm{Na}^+,\,\mathrm{Ca}^{2+},\,\mathrm{Cl}^-\))
          and channel states (open, closed, inactive);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{voltage}}\): membrane potential axis 
          (\(\Delta V\), local field gradients);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{perm}}\): permeability and selectivity of 
          channels and leak pathways;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{exc}}\): axes representing excitability and 
          spike-initiation dynamics;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{energy}}\): axes for ATP-driven pumping and 
          metabolic support of gradients.
\end{enumerate}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(5)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{ion}}\): Nernst-derived ionic potentials 
          (\(E_{\mathrm{ion}}\));
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{grad}}\): electrochemical gradients across 
          membranes;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{exc}}\): excitability potential controlling the 
          stability of the resting state;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{pump}}\): energetic potential associated with 
          ion pumps (e.g.\ \(\mathrm{Na}^+/\mathrm{K}^+\)-ATPase);
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{noise}}\): noise-related potentials affecting 
          spike probability.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

The admissible region \(\Omega(K_5)\) is bounded by structural and 
biophysical thresholds \(\Theta^{(5)}\):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Excitability threshold.}
          \[
              \Delta V \geq \Theta_{\mathrm{exc}}
          \]
          for spike initiation (proto-action potentials);
    \item \textbf{Gradient maintenance.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{grad}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{grad}}
          \]
          ensuring the membrane is not driven to equilibrium;
    \item \textbf{Channel gating stability.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{ion}} \in 
              [\Theta_{\mathrm{ion}}^{\min}, 
               \Theta_{\mathrm{ion}}^{\max}]
          \]
          defining the range in which channels operate without runaway 
          depolarisation or collapse;
    \item \textbf{Pump viability.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{pump}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{pump}}
          \]
          ensuring sufficient energetic input for sustaining gradients.
\end{enumerate}

These thresholds correspond to empirically measurable parameters such as 
resting membrane potentials (\(-30\) to \(-90\,\mathrm{mV}\)), 
channel conductances, reversal potentials, and ATP consumption rates.

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

Dominant flows \(J^{(5)}\) characteristic of excitable continua include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{ion}}\): voltage- and concentration-driven 
          ionic currents through selective channels;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{leak}}\): passive leak currents stabilising 
          or destabilising \(\Delta V\);
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{pump}}\): ATP-driven pumping restoring ionic 
          distributions;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{metabolic}}\): metabolic flows maintaining 
          energetic support for pumps and channel dynamics.
\end{itemize}

Stabilising cycles \(C^{(5)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{excitation}}\): sequence of 
          depolarisation → peak → repolarisation → recovery;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{refrac}}\): cycles enforcing refractory periods 
          and preventing uncontrolled firing;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{leak\text{-}pump}}\): balance cycle between 
          leak-mediated dissipation and pump-driven restoration;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{energy}}\): metabolic cycles replenishing ATP 
          pools required for sustained excitability.
\end{itemize}

Collapse conditions for \(\Omega(K_5)\) arise when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item excitability fails 
          (\(\Delta V < \Theta_{\mathrm{exc}}\));
    \item gradients dissipate below 
          \(\Theta_{\mathrm{grad}}\);
    \item channel noise overwhelms gating control 
          (\(P_{\mathrm{noise}}\) exceeds bounds);
    \item pump energy supply vanishes, causing 
          \(k_5(t) \rightarrow 0\).
\end{enumerate}

Within the observed universe, biophysical conditions across planetary 
environments allow extended regions where \(\Omega(K_5)\) is realised, 
forming the foundation for neural and cognitive organisation at level 
\(K_6\).
