\subsection{Level \(K_{12}\): semantic super–continuum and global coherence}
\label{subsec:toe-k12}

Level \(K_{12}\) describes the semantic super–continuum: the space of
interpretations, meaning-structures and global coherence relations
linking all lower levels \(K_0\)–\(K_{11}\). Whereas \(K_{11}\) treats
meta-theoretical structures, \(K_{12}\) concerns the conditions under
which the observed universe can be \emph{described coherently at all},
across physics, biology, cognition, society, and formal systems.

In the observed universe, \(K_{12}\) is instantiated by the global
semantic landscape formed by scientific languages, conceptual schemes,
symbolic systems, interpretative practices and the shared meaning
structures that allow different continua to be embedded into a single,
mutually coherent whole.

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The axes \(A^{(12)}\) for the observed semantic super–continuum include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{sem}}\): axes of semantic mappings (how concepts,
          models and frameworks refer to structures at lower levels);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{coh}}\): axes of global coherence linking
          theories, interpretations and domains of discourse;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{ref}}\): axes of reference stability (conditions
          under which symbols consistently refer to stable structures);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{meta\!-\!interp}}\): axes of higher-order
          interpretability between scientific and formal frameworks;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{meaning}}\): axes characterising the emergence,
          transformation and stability of meaning structures.
\end{enumerate}

Potentials \(P^{(12)}\) quantify the semantic capacities of the
observed universe:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{sem}}\): semantic integration power (capacity to
          relate theories, models and observations);
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{global}}\): global coherence potential (degree to
          which different domains can be jointly represented);
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{ref}}\): stability of reference across frameworks;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{interp}}\): depth of interpretability between
          conceptual and formal systems;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{meaning}}\): ability to sustain meaning cycles
          across cognitive, social and formal domains.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

Admissible states \(\Omega(K_{12})\) for the observed universe are
delimited by thresholds \(\Theta^{(12)}\) expressing the minimal
requirements for coherent global meaning-structures:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{semantic coherence thresholds}: mappings between
          different theoretical and observational domains must remain
          jointly coherent;
    \item \textbf{interpretability thresholds}: frameworks at
          \(K_2\)–\(K_{11}\) must remain mutually interpretable in at
          least one global semantic scheme;
    \item \textbf{reference thresholds}: reference must be stable enough
          for long-lived meaning structures to exist;
    \item \textbf{integration thresholds}: the semantic continuum must
          integrate scientific, cognitive and social meaning structures
          without collapse.
\end{enumerate}

Collapse at \(K_{12}\) corresponds to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fragmentation of semantic space into incompatible islands;
    \item systematic loss of interpretability between major domains
          (e.g.\ physics ↔ biology, cognition ↔ society);
    \item breakdowns of global coherence preventing unified
          representations of the world;
    \item drift or instability of reference that undermines meaning
          cycles.
\end{itemize}

Empirically, the observed universe remains within
\(\Omega(K_{12})\): despite known tensions across scientific and
conceptual domains, the global semantic landscape remains coherent
enough to support unified physical theories, biological models,
cognitive sciences, formal systems and social meaning structures.

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

The dominant flows \(J^{(12)}\) in the observed semantic super–continuum
include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{interpretation flows}: linking theories, models and
          observations into jointly meaningful structures;
    \item \textbf{semantic circulation flows}: stabilising meaning
          across cognitive, social and formal domains;
    \item \textbf{reference flows}: maintenance of stable symbol–referent
          relationships;
    \item \textbf{coherence flows}: adjustments that maintain alignment
          between disparate theoretical and conceptual frameworks.
\end{itemize}

Stabilising cycles \(C^{(12)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{meaning cycles}: creation, refinement and transmission
          of meaning across generations and communities;
    \item \textbf{coherence cycles}: iterative reconciliation of
          competing frameworks into stable global structures;
    \item \textbf{interpretation cycles}: recursive embedding of theories
          into higher-order meaning structures;
    \item \textbf{reference cycles}: formation and preservation of
          robust symbol–world mappings.
\end{itemize}

Under current empirical conditions, the observed universe supports a
stable \(K_{12}\) semantic continuum: diverse scientific, cognitive,
formal and cultural systems remain sufficiently coherent to constitute
a single global meaning-structure in which all lower continua can be
jointly interpreted.
