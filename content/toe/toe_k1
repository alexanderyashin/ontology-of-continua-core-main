\subsection{Level \(K_1\): minimal observable distinctions and energetic axes}
\label{subsec:toe-k1}

Level \(K_1\) represents the first emergence of observable distinctions in the
sense of the Ontology of Continua. 
While \(K_0\) only provides the logical preconditions for a continuum, 
\(K_1\) introduces the minimal structure required for physically meaningful
measurements: energetic differences, temporal progression, and the 
proto-axes from which classical and quantum fields of \(K_2\) can arise.

In the observed universe this level corresponds to the appearance of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item distinguishable states with different energetic values;
    \item a monotonic parameter enabling ordered updates 
          (interpretable as physical time);
    \item the first measurable quantities that allow the definition of 
          dynamical laws at higher levels.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The relevant axes \(A^{(1)}\) for the observed universe include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\Delta E}\): energetic distinctions between admissible states;
    \item \(A_t\): an ordering axis providing a monotonic update parameter;
    \item \(A_{\Delta S}\): distinguishability in entropy or configuration count.
\end{enumerate}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(1)}\) are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_E\): energy as an extensive quantity, measurable through 
          transition work or action contributions;
    \item \(P_t\): temporal potential representing the rate of structural 
          updates;
    \item \(P_\Omega\): the structural potential linked to the size of the 
          accessible configuration set.
\end{itemize}

All of these quantities correspond to empirically measurable components.
Their numerical forms for the observed universe are grounded in cosmological
data (see Appendix~\ref{app:toe-constants-and-parameters}).

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

The admissible region \(\Omega(K_1)\) is bounded by structural thresholds
\(\Theta^{(1)}\) ensuring that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item energetic differences are resolvable,
          \[
              \Delta E \geq \Theta_{\Delta E};
          \]
    \item temporal progression remains monotonic,
          \[
              \frac{dt}{d\tau} > 0;
          \]
    \item the configuration-space measure does not collapse,
          \[
              \mu(\Omega(K_1)) > 0.
          \]
\end{enumerate}

For the observed universe these thresholds correspond to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item minimal resolvable energy quanta on the order of 
          \(10^{-34}\text{–}10^{-33}\,\mathrm{J}\)  
          (depending on the system considered);
    \item a strictly positive global expansion rate at early times, 
          guaranteeing monotonic \(A_t\);
    \item non-vanishing entropy gradients that prevent degeneracy.
\end{itemize}

These conditions are satisfied throughout the cosmological history of the 
universe except in hypothetical singular initial limits, which lie outside 
\(\Omega(K_1)\) by construction of the model.

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

The dominant flows \(J^{(1)}\) stabilising the continuum at this level are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(J_E\): flows of energy between admissible states;
    \item \(J_t\): the structural update flow generating sequential ordering;
    \item \(J_\Omega\): flows that enlarge or maintain the accessible 
          configuration region.
\end{itemize}

A minimal stabilising cycle \(C^{(1)}\) consists of repeated transitions
\[
    s \longrightarrow s' \longrightarrow s'' \longrightarrow \dots
\]
such that each step preserves membership in \(\Omega(K_1)\) and keeps 
\(\Delta E\) and \(\Delta S\) within admissible thresholds.

Collapse modes at this level correspond to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item loss of resolvable energetic distinctions 
          (\(\Delta E < \Theta_{\Delta E}\));
    \item breakdown of temporal monotonicity;
    \item degeneracy of configuration-space measure 
          (\(\mu(\Omega(K_1)) \to 0\)).
\end{enumerate}

All higher continua \(K_2\)–\(K_{12}\) rely on the maintenance of these
conditions. The observed universe remains within \(\Omega(K_1)\) across its 
entire classical and quantum history, enabling the subsequent emergence of 
fields, matter, structure and information.
