\subsection{Level \(K_X\): <short descriptor>}
\label{subsec:toe-kX}

Here we instantiate level \(K_X\) of the Ontology of Continua for the
observed universe.

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}
We identify the relevant axes \(A^{(X)}\) and potentials \(P^{(X)}\)
for this level (see Table~\ref{tab:toe-kX-axes-potentials}) and map
them to measurable quantities in the observed universe.

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}
We specify threshold ranges \(\Theta^{(X)}\) that delimit the
admissible region \(\Omega(K_X)\) for the observed universe, and show
that the measured parameters lie within this region at least for a
finite time window.

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}
We describe the dominant flows \(J^{(X)}\) and cycles \(C^{(X)}\) that
keep the observed universe within \(\Omega(K_X)\), and outline the
collapse modes that would correspond to exiting this region.
