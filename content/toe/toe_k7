\subsection{Level \(K_7\): social systems and institutional continua}
\label{subsec:toe-k7}

Level \(K_7\) describes social continua: systems in which interacting 
cognitive agents form structured patterns of cooperation, communication, 
institutional organisation and shared symbolic frameworks.  
Whereas \(K_6\) provides cognitive stability for individual agents, 
\(K_7\) captures the emergence of multi-agent structures whose dynamics 
cannot be reduced to isolated cognitive processes.

In the observed universe this level corresponds to social groups, 
communicative networks, shared norms, coordinated tasks and 
institutional arrangements that persist through recurrent cycles and 
maintain functional stability across time.

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The characteristic axes \(A^{(7)}\) include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{comm}}\): axes describing communicative capacity, 
          message fidelity and semantic coherence;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{coop}}\): cooperation and coordination axes 
          determining multi-agent alignment;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{inst}}\): axes representing institutional 
          structures and role differentiation;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{norm}}\): normative axes governing shared rules, 
          expectations and constraints;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{trust}}\): axes for stability of trust relations 
          and reliability assessments.
\end{enumerate}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(7)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{comm}}\): communicative potentials such as 
          channel bandwidth, linguistic structure and noise tolerance;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{coop}}\): cooperative potentials determining 
          alignment and shared goals;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{inst}}\): potentials associated with institutional 
          complexity, hierarchy and functional differentiation;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{norm}}\): normative potentials stabilising 
          behavioural expectations;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{trust}}\): potentials linked to mutual reliability, 
          reputation and expectation consistency.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

The admissible region \(\Omega(K_7)\) is delimited by thresholds 
\(\Theta^{(7)}\) ensuring that social organisation remains coherent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Communicative viability.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{comm}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{comm}}
          \]
          ensuring semantic and pragmatic coherence of interactions;
    \item \textbf{Cooperative stability.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{coop}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{coop}}
          \]
          supporting stable multi-agent coordination;
    \item \textbf{Institutional coherence.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{inst}} \in
              [\Theta_{\mathrm{inst}}^{\min}, 
               \Theta_{\mathrm{inst}}^{\max}]
          \]
          avoiding both collapse and excessive rigidity;
    \item \textbf{Normative consistency.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{norm}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{norm}}
          \]
          preventing behavioural drift that destabilises group structure;
    \item \textbf{Trust continuity.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{trust}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{trust}}
          \]
          maintaining cooperative viability across time.
\end{enumerate}

In empirical terms these thresholds correspond to measurable features 
such as communication fidelity, cooperation rates, institutional 
durability, norm compliance and trust metrics.

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

Dominant flows \(J^{(7)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{comm}}\): communicative flows transmitting 
          information between agents;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{coop}}\): cooperative flows coordinating joint 
          actions and shared resource usage;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{inst}}\): institutional flows regulating roles, 
          responsibilities and decision structures;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{norm}}\): normative flows reinforcing or adjusting 
          behavioural expectations;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{trust}}\): trust-update flows maintaining 
          reliability assessments across interactions.
\end{itemize}

Stabilising cycles \(C^{(7)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{comm}}\): cycles ensuring communicative coherence 
          through recurrent information exchange;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{coop}}\): cooperative–alignment cycles maintaining 
          shared goals and joint actions;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{inst}}\): institutional cycles renewing 
          organisational structures over time;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{norm}}\): cycles stabilising normative behaviour 
          across repeated interactions;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{trust}}\): cycles updating and reinforcing 
          trust structures between agents.
\end{itemize}

Collapse of \(\Omega(K_7)\) occurs when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item communication degrades below the semantic threshold;
    \item cooperative alignment fails 
          (\(P_{\mathrm{coop}} \le \Theta_{\mathrm{coop}}\));
    \item institutional rigidity or fragmentation disrupts stability;
    \item normative structures drift beyond allowable bounds;
    \item trust collapses, causing the overall coherence measure 
          \(k_7(t)\) to approach zero.
\end{enumerate}

Under observed conditions on Earth, many social systems remain within 
\(\Omega(K_7)\) for extended periods, enabling the formation of 
civilisational continua at level \(K_8\).
