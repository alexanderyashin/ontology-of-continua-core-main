\subsection{Level \(K_9\): theoretical and paradigm-level continua}
\label{subsec:toe-k9}

Level \(K_9\) describes continua of scientific theories, conceptual
frameworks, formal models and inferential schemas.  
Where \(K_8\) concerns large-scale civilisational systems, \(K_9\)
captures the structural dynamics of knowledge production: the space of
theories, the transitions between them, and the thresholds that
determine coherence, explanatory power and empirical adequacy.

For the observed universe, the relevant instance is the global
scientific framework accumulated across physics, chemistry, biology,
cognitive science, and social theory.

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The axes \(A^{(9)}\) for the observed theoretical landscape include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{paradigm}}\): paradigmatic axes distinguishing
          major scientific worldviews and conceptual schemes;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{model}}\): axes of modelling frameworks
          (continuous vs.\ discrete, field-based vs.\ agent-based,
          statistical vs.\ mechanistic);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{formal}}\): axes of formal languages, logics and
          representational structures used in scientific theories;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{inferential}}\): axes capturing inferential rules,
          methodology, and epistemic commitments;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{semantic}}\): axes determining the mapping between
          theoretical constructs and empirical data.
\end{enumerate}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(9)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{coh}}\): coherence and internal consistency of a
          theory or model class;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{exp}}\): explanatory depth and unifying power;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{pred}}\): predictive accuracy and robustness across
          domains;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{comp}}\): computational and representational
          efficiency (expressive power of the formalism);
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{method}}\): methodological potential, including
          reproducibility, falsifiability and scalability.
\end{itemize}

These potentials correspond to empirical indicators such as predictive
success, cross-disciplinary compatibility, stability of inferential
schemas and resilience to anomalies.

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

Admissible states \(\Omega(K_9)\) are defined by thresholds
\(\Theta^{(9)}\) that ensure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{coherence thresholds} (non-contradiction, internal
          structural alignment);
    \item \textbf{consistency thresholds} (compatibility with empirical
          data and other accepted theories);
    \item \textbf{explanatory thresholds} determining the minimal
          capacity of a theory to unify disparate observations;
    \item \textbf{semantic thresholds} maintaining stable
          theory–observation mappings;
    \item \textbf{methodological thresholds} ensuring adequate falsifiability,
          reproducibility and inferential control.
\end{enumerate}

Crossing any of these thresholds corresponds to exiting
\(\Omega(K_9)\), producing stagnation, degeneracy or collapse of a
theoretical programme.  
Measured indicators of contemporary scientific practice show that the
global theoretical landscape remains inside \(\Omega(K_9)\), albeit
with persistent tensions at frontier domains (quantum gravity,
complexity theory, high-level cognition).

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

The dominant flows \(J^{(9)}\) in the observed theoretical continuum
include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{theory}}\): flows of theory refinement, extension
          and reduction;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{model}}\): flows of model development and cross-model
          translation;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{validation}}\): empirical validation flows linking
          theories to experimental results;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{anomaly}}\): flows triggered by anomalies and
          inconsistencies generating pressure toward paradigm shifts;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{integration}}\): flows integrating disparate
          theories into unified conceptual frameworks.
\end{itemize}

Stabilising cycles \(C^{(9)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \textbf{theory cycle} (proposal → derivation →
          validation → refinement);
    \item the \textbf{paradigm cycle} (normal science → anomalies →
          crisis → restructuring);
    \item the \textbf{model-validation cycle} linking theoretical models
          to empirical data;
    \item the \textbf{anomaly-resolution cycle} generating new axes and
          potentials when tensions exceed thresholds.
\end{itemize}

A collapse mode at \(K_9\) occurs when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item anomalies accumulate without triggering paradigm-level
          restructuring (\(T_9>0\));
    \item theoretical programmes degenerate (loss of explanatory power);
    \item methodological and epistemic frameworks diverge
          (\(\Theta_{\mathrm{method}}\) violated);
    \item semantic mappings become unstable (loss of empirical
          anchoring).
\end{enumerate}

At the present epoch, the observed theoretical system remains within
\(\Omega(K_9)\), though several frontier tensions indicate proximity to
\(\partial\Omega(K_9)\). These tensions serve as generative pressures for
the emergence of higher-level continua \(K_{10}\) and \(K_{11}\).
