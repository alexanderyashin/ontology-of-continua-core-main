\subsection{Level \(K_{10}\): formal–recursive continua in the observed universe}
\label{subsec:toe-k10}

Level \(K_{10}\) corresponds to continua whose states are formal systems:
logical calculi, axiom schemes, formal grammars, models of computation,
and the chains of derivations and interpretations that relate them.
Unlike \(K_9\), which describes the dynamics of scientific theories,
\(K_{10}\) concerns the structural, symbolic and recursive foundations
that make such theories expressible and transformable at all.

In the observed universe, the principal instance is the global ensemble
of formal mathematical systems, programming languages, proof
assistants, type theories and computational models used across the
sciences.

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The axes \(A^{(10)}\) for the observed formal–recursive landscape
include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{logic}}\): axes over types of logic
          (classical, intuitionistic, modal, higher-order);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{recursion}}\): axes measuring the kinds and depths
          of recursion (primitive, general, higher-order);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{axiom}}\): axes representing axiom systems
          (ZFC, HoTT, Peano arithmetic, type-theoretic foundations);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{comp}}\): axes of computational models
          (Turing machines, \(\lambda\)-calculus, automata, rewriting
          systems);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{semantics}}\): axes determining mappings between
          syntax, semantics, and meta-semantics.
\end{enumerate}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(10)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{expr}}\): expressive power (what can be stated);
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{comp}}\): computability and computational
          completeness;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{prov}}\): provability and deductive strength;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{rec}}\): recursive depth and closure of
          definitions;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{sem}}\): semantic stability across interpretations
          and translations.
\end{itemize}

These quantities are instantiated empirically through the observed
distribution of formal languages, proof frameworks, computational
architectures and their inter-translation networks.

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

Admissible states \(\Omega(K_{10})\) for the observed universe are
delimited by thresholds \(\Theta^{(10)}\) corresponding to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{consistency thresholds}: a formal system must not
          derive contradictions;
    \item \textbf{completeness/expressivity thresholds}: expressive
          capacity must exceed minimal requirements for modelling
          lower-level continua \(K_0\)–\(K_9\);
    \item \textbf{computability thresholds}: the system must support
          sufficiently rich recursion and computation to define and
          manipulate relevant structures;
    \item \textbf{semantic thresholds}: interpretation maps must remain
          stable across proof transformations and translations.
\end{enumerate}

Crossing these thresholds yields classical collapse modes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item inconsistency (loss of \(\Omega(K_{10})\));
    \item semantic instability (non-well-founded interpretations);
    \item loss of expressive power (inability to encode necessary
          structures);
    \item failure of recursive closure (definitions cannot be completed).
\end{itemize}

Empirically, the contemporary formal landscape remains within
\(\Omega(K_{10})\): major systems (ZFC, dependent type theories,
computational calculi) satisfy the necessary thresholds, though each
exhibits intrinsic limitations (Gödel incompleteness, uncomputability,
expressive hierarchies).

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

The dominant flows \(J^{(10)}\) in the observed formal–recursive
continuum include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{proof flows}: derivations, reductions and transformations
          within formal systems;
    \item \textbf{computational flows}: evaluation, execution and
          recursion across computational models;
    \item \textbf{translation flows}: encoding and decoding between
          logics, calculi, languages and models;
    \item \textbf{interpretation flows}: mappings between syntax,
          semantics and meta-semantics.
\end{itemize}

Stabilising cycles \(C^{(10)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \textbf{axiomatic cycle}: axiom → derivation → theorem →
          interpretation → refinement of axioms;
    \item the \textbf{recursive cycle}: definition → evaluation →
          fixed-point → generalisation;
    \item the \textbf{soundness–completeness cycle}: establishing and
          maintaining correspondence between proof systems and models;
    \item the \textbf{translation–normalisation cycle}: maintaining
          commutativity between syntactic and semantic transformations.
\end{itemize}

Collapse at \(K_{10}\) occurs when:
\begin{itemize}
    \item contradictions propagate through proof flows
          (\(T_{10}>0\));
    \item translation systems fail (loss of semantic coherence);
    \item recursion becomes unbounded or undefined (divergent
          processes);
    \item expressive power falls below the threshold needed to represent
          lower-level continua.
\end{itemize}

Under current empirical conditions, the observed formal systems remain
stable within \(\Omega(K_{10})\), though frontier research in logic,
type theory and theoretical computer science marks the boundary
\(\partial\Omega(K_{10})\) and generates pressure toward the
meta-theoretical structures of \(K_{11}\).
