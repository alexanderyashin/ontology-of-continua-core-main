\subsection{Level \(K_8\): civilisational continua in the observed universe}
\label{subsec:toe-k8}

At level \(K_8\) we treat large-scale human civilisations as instances
of civilisational continua embedded in the physical universe. The
axes \(A^{(8)}\) for the observed human world include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item population and demographic axes \(A_\mathrm{Pop}\);
    \item infrastructural axes \(A_\mathrm{Infra}\) (transport, energy
          grids, communication networks);
    \item technological axes \(A_\mathrm{Tech}\);
    \item economic reproduction axes \(A_\mathrm{Econ}\);
    \item informational and cultural axes \(A_\mathrm{Info}\).
\end{itemize}

Potentials \(P^{(8)}\) for the observed civilisation include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item energy density and power throughput per capita and per unit
          area;
    \item throughput of material and informational flows;
    \item redundancy and repair capacity for critical infrastructures;
    \item institutional and cultural coherence indices.
\end{itemize}

Numerically, these are represented by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item global primary energy consumption and its distribution across
          sources;
    \item average and peak power per capita;
    \item estimates of infrastructural coverage (transport, digital
          networks);
    \item measured indicators of economic and institutional stability
          (aggregated into structural indices).
\end{itemize}

Thresholds \(\Theta^{(8)}\) for the observed civilisation include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item minimal energy and logistics thresholds for maintaining a
          connected global infrastructure;
    \item thresholds of informational coherence beyond which
          large-scale coordination breaks down;
    \item demographic thresholds below which repair and reproduction
          cycles cannot be sustained.
\end{itemize}

We do not claim that these thresholds are known with high precision.
Rather, we show that they \emph{can} be embedded into the general
framework of \(\Theta^{(8)}\) and that measured values for the
observed civilisation lie in ranges compatible with a non-empty and
connected \(\Omega(K_8)\) at the present epoch.
