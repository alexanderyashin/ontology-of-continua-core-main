\subsection{Level \(K_8\): civilisational continua in the observed universe}
\label{subsec:toe-k8}

Level \(K_8\) describes civilisational continua: large-scale,
self-maintaining aggregates of social, technological and infrastructural
systems that reproduce themselves through coupled flows of energy,
matter, information and institutional organisation.  
Where \(K_7\) captures multi-agent social organisation, \(K_8\) concerns
the emergence of macro-systems whose stability depends on global
logistics, technological density, demographic structure and long-range
information flows.

In the observed universe, the primary instance is the global human
civilisation during the current epoch.

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

Following the general definition of \(K_8\), the relevant axes
\(A^{(8)}\) for the observed civilisation are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{Pop}}\): population and demographic axes
          determining reproduction, labour capacity and repair cycles;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{Infra}}\): infrastructural axes covering transport
          networks, energy grids, water systems, digital connectivity;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{Tech}}\): technological axes measuring density,
          capability and interdependence of technologies;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{Econ}}\): economic axes describing material
          reproduction, capital flows and production窶電istribution cycles;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{Info}}\): informational and cultural axes shaping
          storage, transmission and coherence of large-scale knowledge.
\end{enumerate}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(8)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{energy}}\): energy density and available power
          throughput per capita and per unit area;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{material}}\): throughput of material flows,
          including logistics and supply chains;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{info}}\): informational potential, including storage
          redundancy, communication bandwidth and coherence indices;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{repair}}\): repair and maintenance potential for
          critical infrastructures;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{econ}}\): potentials associated with economic
          reproduction, investment cycles and organisational stability.
\end{itemize}

Empirical instantiation is given by quantities such as global primary
energy consumption, average and peak power per capita, transport and
digital infrastructure coverage, institutional performance indicators,
and demographic trends. These are consolidated into the data tables in
Appendix~\ref{app:toe-constants-and-parameters}.

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

The observed civilisation occupies a region of admissible states
\(\Omega(K_8)\) determined by thresholds \(\Theta^{(8)}\) of several
types:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Energy threshold \(\Theta_E\).}
          A minimal energy density is required to sustain coordinated
          global infrastructures and maintain the flows \(J^{(8)}\).
    \item \textbf{Logistic threshold \(\Theta_L\).}
          Transport and supply-chain capacity must exceed minimal
          connectivity bounds, ensuring the operation of industrial and
          technological subsystems.
    \item \textbf{Informational coherence threshold \(\Theta_I\).}
          Long-range communication must maintain semantic and systemic
          coherence; below this threshold global coordination fails.
    \item \textbf{Repair threshold \(\Theta_M\).}
          Infrastructure repair capacity must at least match aggregate
          rates of degradation and amortisation.
    \item \textbf{Demographic threshold \(\Theta_R\).}
          Population structure must support replacement, skill transfer
          and the reproduction of institutional roles.
\end{enumerate}

These thresholds define the boundary \(\partial\Omega(K_8)\): when any
\(P^{(8)}\) approaches its limit or when structural tension \(T_8\)
increases beyond zero, the civilisational continuum risks collapse.
Measured values for the present epoch lie within ranges where
\(\Omega(K_8)\) is non-empty and connected.

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

Dominant flows \(J^{(8)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{energy}}\): flows of energy generation, transport
          and consumption;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{material}}\): flows of goods, raw materials,
          manufacturing and distribution;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{logistics}}\): long-range transport, shipping,
          aviation and digital logistics;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{info}}\): flows of information across media,
          networks and cultural memory systems;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{population}}\): demographic flows, including
          migration, reproduction and education.
\end{itemize}

Stabilising cycles \(C^{(8)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Production窶電istribution窶田onsumption cycles}
          ensuring the continuity of material and economic reproduction;
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure maintenance cycles}
          coupling repair capacity to degradation rates;
    \item \textbf{Energy generation窶電istribution cycles}
          maintaining systemic power availability;
    \item \textbf{Informational cycles} sustaining collective memory,
          scientific knowledge and institutional coherence.
\end{itemize}

Collapse of \(K_8\) occurs when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item energy density falls below \(\Theta_E\);
    \item logistic capacity fails (\(L_{\mathrm{capacity}} <
          L_{\mathrm{demand}}\));
    \item repair cycles break (\(M_{\mathrm{repair}} <
          M_{\mathrm{demand}}\));
    \item informational coherence drops below \(\Theta_I\);
    \item demographic decline passes \(\Theta_R\), making institutional
          reproduction impossible.
\end{enumerate}

Under present empirical conditions, the global human civilisation
remains within \(\Omega(K_8)\), though several axes lie close to their
respective thresholds, making long-term stability a contingent property.
