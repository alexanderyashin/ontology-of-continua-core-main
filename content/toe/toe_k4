\subsection{Level \(K_4\): protocellular organisation and compartmental continua}
\label{subsec:toe-k4}

Level \(K_4\) marks the transition from chemical organisation 
(\(K_3\)) to protocellular continuity: systems where reactions, transport 
processes and environmental exchanges occur within partially insulated 
compartments. This is the level at which catalytic networks, 
compartment boundaries and energy gradients jointly stabilise cycles 
that can be meaningfully called proto-metabolic.

In the observed universe this corresponds to environments where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item membrane-like structures or mineral compartments provide
          semi-permeable boundaries;
    \item catalytic reaction sets (e.g.\ RAF networks) are sustained
          within finite regions of space;
    \item ion and molecule fluxes across the boundary are regulated;
    \item internal and external potentials differ sufficiently to drive
          energy-consuming cycles.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The characteristic axes \(A^{(4)}\) for protocellular continua include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{comp}}\): axes describing compartment structure,
          permeability and boundary stability;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{flux}}\): axes for transport of ions and 
          molecules (\(J_{\mathrm{in}}, J_{\mathrm{out}}\));
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{cat}}\): axes representing catalytic activity and 
          reaction network connectivity;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{grad}}\): axes for electrochemical and energetic 
          gradients across the boundary;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{energy}}\): axes for energy turnover and 
          proto-metabolic coupling.
\end{enumerate}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(4)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{mem}}\): membrane or boundary potential, 
          determined by permeability, thickness and composition;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{grad}}\): electrochemical potentials generating 
          directional flows;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{cat}}\): catalytic potentials determined by 
          reaction rates and network structure;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{energy}}\): energetic potentials driving 
          proto-metabolic cycles.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

The admissible region \(\Omega(K_4)\) is bounded by thresholds 
\(\Theta^{(4)}\) ensuring that compartmental organisation is stable and 
reaction networks can operate coherently:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item membrane stability:
          \[
              \Theta_{\mathrm{mem}} < P_{\mathrm{mem}} < 
                  \Theta_{\mathrm{mem}}^{\max},
          \]
          ensuring neither rupture nor impermeability;
    \item gradient maintenance:
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{grad}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{grad}},
          \]
          enabling energy transduction and directional flows;
    \item catalytic viability:
          \[
              V^{\ddagger} < \Theta_{\mathrm{cat}}^{\max},
          \]
          permitting sustained reaction sequences;
    \item energy availability:
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{energy}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{energy}},
          \]
          ensuring at least one closed metabolic-like cycle.
\end{enumerate}

Empirical analogues include lipid vesicles, mineral pores and 
proto-membrane assemblies observed in prebiotic chemistry experiments 
and geological environments.

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

Dominant flows \(J^{(4)}\) characteristic of protocellular organisation 
include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{in}}\) and \(J_{\mathrm{out}}\): passive, 
          facilitated and active transport across boundaries;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{metabolic}}\): flows through reaction pathways 
          generating or consuming energy;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{redox}}\): redox-driven flows supplying reducing 
          or oxidising equivalents;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{pump}}\): energy-driven pumping processes that 
          maintain internal gradients.
\end{itemize}

Stable protocellular behaviour requires coupled cycles \(C^{(4)}\), such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{RAF-core}}\): catalytic core cycles sustaining 
          reaction networks;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{metabolic}}\): cycles driving energy turnover;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{grad}}\): leak–pump balancing cycles stabilising 
          electrochemical gradients;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{turnover}}\): material turnover and structural 
          renewal cycles.
\end{itemize}

Collapse of \(\Omega(K_4)\) occurs when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item membrane integrity fails (rupture or full impermeability);
    \item gradients cannot be maintained (\(P_{\mathrm{grad}} \le 
          \Theta_{\mathrm{grad}}\));
    \item catalytic processes stall due to unfavourable potentials;
    \item energy cycles cannot close, causing \(k_4(t) \rightarrow 0\).
\end{enumerate}

Throughout planetary environments where life could originate, the 
observed universe satisfies the thresholds for \(\Omega(K_4)\) over 
extended time windows, enabling the emergence of excitable systems at 
level \(K_5\).
