\subsection{Level \(K_6\): cognitive continua and patterned neural organisation}
\label{subsec:toe-k6}

Level \(K_6\) represents cognitive continua: systems in which 
neural activity forms stable-yet-flexible patterns, structured by 
attention-like selection mechanisms, memory traces and predictive 
dynamics. Whereas \(K_5\) provides excitable membranes capable of 
threshold-dependent signalling, \(K_6\) introduces patterned, 
multi-component organisation in which individual excitation events 
combine into stable cognitive states.

In the observed universe this level corresponds to neural systems 
whose activity can be described in terms of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item distributed patterns \(W(t)\) of co-activation across 
          cell assemblies;
    \item selective axes modulating which patterns dominate 
          (attention, salience, gating);
    \item predictive mechanisms adjusting flows based on expected 
          sensory input;
    \item memory traces providing continuity and bias to future 
          state transitions.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The characteristic axes \(A^{(6)}\) include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{sel}}\): selection/attention axis controlling 
          competitive interactions between patterns;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{cmp}}\): axes representing comparison and 
          discrimination relations between active patterns;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{bind}}\): axes for binding distributed features 
          into coherent cognitive states;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{pred}}\): axes for predictive updates and 
          expectation signals;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{mem}}\): axes for memory trace strength and 
          persistence (\(M_{\mathrm{trace}}\)).
\end{enumerate}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(6)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{act}}\): activation potentials of neuronal 
          assemblies;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{sel}}\): selective potentials regulating 
          attention-like competition;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{pred}}\): predictive potentials shaping 
          expectation–error flows;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{syn}}\): synaptic potentials governing 
          plasticity and pattern stability;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{mem}}\): potentials associated with long- and 
          short-term traces.
\end{itemize}

These quantities correspond to measurable neural parameters such as 
firing rates, synchrony levels, synaptic weights, prediction–error 
signals, and memory retention times.

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

The admissible region \(\Omega(K_6)\) is delimited by thresholds 
\(\Theta^{(6)}\) ensuring that patterned cognitive activity is coherent 
and dynamically stable:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pattern stability.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{act}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{act}}
          \]
          for at least one pattern \(W(t)\);
    \item \textbf{Selective coherence.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{sel}} \in 
              [\Theta_{\mathrm{sel}}^{\min}, 
               \Theta_{\mathrm{sel}}^{\max}]
          \]
          enabling one pattern to dominate without runaway suppression;
    \item \textbf{Predictive viability.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{pred}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{pred}}
          \]
          ensuring that prediction–error flows remain bounded;
    \item \textbf{Memory trace persistence.}
          \[
              P_{\mathrm{mem}} > \Theta_{\mathrm{mem}}
          \]
          providing continuity across state transitions.
\end{enumerate}

These conditions correspond to empirically observed ranges for neural 
signal-to-noise ratios, attentional modulation intervals, error-coding 
stability windows and typical time scales of memory consolidation.

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

Dominant flows \(J^{(6)}\) characteristic of cognitive continua include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{sel}}\): flows implementing competitive selection 
          among patterns;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{cmp}}\): comparison flows assessing similarities 
          and differences between active assemblies;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{bind}}\): binding flows forming coherent 
          multi-feature states;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{pred}}\): prediction–error flows adjusting neural 
          dynamics based on expected input;
    \item \(J_{\mathrm{mem}}\): memory-update flows reinforcing or 
          weakening traces.
\end{itemize}

The stabilising cycles \(C^{(6)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{sel}}\): recurrent selection cycles stabilising 
          dominant patterns;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{cmp}}\): discrimination cycles enabling coherent 
          perceptual differentiation;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{bind}}\): feature-binding cycles generating unified 
          cognitive states;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{pred}}\): predictive cycles minimising error 
          and ensuring internal coherence;
    \item \(C_{\mathrm{mem}}\): cycles maintaining memory traces and 
          long-term pattern structure.
\end{itemize}

Collapse of \(\Omega(K_6)\) occurs when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item no pattern satisfies the stability threshold 
          (\(P_{\mathrm{act}} \le \Theta_{\mathrm{act}}\));
    \item selection becomes either too weak or too strong, destroying 
          coherence;
    \item predictive flows diverge 
          (\(P_{\mathrm{pred}} < \Theta_{\mathrm{pred}}\));
    \item memory traces decay beyond critical thresholds, 
          \(P_{\mathrm{mem}} \to 0\).
\end{enumerate}

Under neural and environmental conditions observed in biological systems 
on Earth, \(\Omega(K_6)\) is robustly instantiated, providing the 
structural basis for social, communicative and institutional continua 
at level \(K_7\).
