\subsection{Level \(K_{11}\): meta-theoretical continua in the observed universe}
\label{subsec:toe-k11}

Level \(K_{11}\) describes continua whose states are \emph{meta-level}
structures: theories about theories, frameworks that organise formal
systems, and the spaces of admissible transformations between them.
Whereas \(K_{10}\) concerns individual formal calculi and computational
models, \(K_{11}\) concerns the architecture of relationships among
them: interpretability hierarchies, categorical liftings, meta-logical
constraints, and the evolution of scientific frameworks.

The observed universe instantiates \(K_{11}\) primarily through the
meta-structures used in contemporary mathematics, physics, computer
science and theoretical modelling.

\paragraph{Axes and potentials.}

The axes \(A^{(11)}\) relevant for the observed meta-theoretical
landscape include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{meta\!-\!logic}}\): axes characterising
          admissible metalogical principles (reflection, conservativity,
          schema strength);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{cat}}\): axes for categorical and higher-categorical
          structures (functors, natural transformations, adjunctions,
          \(n\)-categorical composition);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{model}}\): axes describing permissible
          interpretations between whole classes of theories;
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{meta\!-\!rec}}\): axes measuring degrees of
          meta-recursion (self-description, reflective operators);
    \item \(A_{\mathrm{framework}}\): axes corresponding to paradigmatic
          scientific frameworks: e.g.\ classical field theory, quantum
          theory, statistical mechanics, category-theoretic semantics.
\end{enumerate}

Potentials \(P^{(11)}\) measure the structural capacities of these
meta-systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{str}}\): structural coherence (compatibility of
          frameworks, well-definedness of transformations);
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{lift}}\): capacity to lift structures from
          \(K_{10}\) to higher levels (e.g.\ categorical semantics of
          type theories);
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{unify}}\): ability to integrate multiple
          theoretical domains within a shared meta-framework;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{meta\!-\!rec}}\): stability of reflective
          definitions and meta-operators;
    \item \(P_{\mathrm{corr}}\): correlation capacity that ensures
          different theories remain mutually interpretable.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Thresholds and admissible states.}

Admissible states \(\Omega(K_{11})\) for the observed universe are
delimited by thresholds \(\Theta^{(11)}\) associated with:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{coherence thresholds}: categorical and
          meta-logical structures must remain non-contradictory;
    \item \textbf{interpretability thresholds}: theories must remain
          mutually interpretable within at least one coherent framework;
    \item \textbf{reflection thresholds}: reflective operators must not
          generate paradoxes or break definability conditions;
    \item \textbf{integration thresholds}: meta-frameworks must support
          the unification of theories required for levels \(K_2\)–\(K_{10}\).
\end{enumerate}

Crossing these thresholds corresponds to collapse modes such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item breakdowns of meta-logical consistency
          (e.g.\ paradoxical reflection principles);
    \item loss of interpretability between major theoretical domains;
    \item failure of categorical coherence (non-associativity,
          obstructed functorial liftings);
    \item fragmentation of scientific frameworks into incompatible
          theoretical islands.
\end{itemize}

Empirically, the observed scientific and formal meta-landscape remains
within \(\Omega(K_{11})\): modern mathematics, physics and computation
exhibit strong categorical and meta-logical coherence, despite known
limitations (e.g.\ independence phenomena, model-theoretic
non-uniqueness, competing paradigms).

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

Dominant flows \(J^{(11)}\) in the observed meta-theoretical continuum
include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{interpretation flows}: mappings between full theories
          (e.g.\ categorical semantics of type theories, dualities in
          physics);
    \item \textbf{abstraction flows}: lifting structures from concrete
          calculi to meta-frameworks;
    \item \textbf{unification flows}: integration of multiple scientific
          frameworks under shared principles (e.g.\ renormalisation,
          category-theoretic semantics, information-theoretic models);
    \item \textbf{reflective flows}: meta-operators describing theories
          within extended theories.
\end{itemize}

Stabilising cycles \(C^{(11)}\) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{categorical coherence cycles}: ensuring that
          compositions, adjunctions and functorial liftings preserve
          structure;
    \item \textbf{framework refinement cycles}: development of improved
          meta-frameworks for physics, computation and logic;
    \item \textbf{interpretation cycles}: back-and-forth translation
          between theories ensuring global compatibility;
    \item \textbf{meta-reflection cycles}: controlled self-description
          preserving definability and consistency.
\end{itemize}

Collapse at \(K_{11}\) occurs when:
\begin{itemize}
    \item meta-logical inconsistencies propagate into lower levels;
    \item interpretability between major scientific domains fails;
    \item categorical structures lose coherence;
    \item reflective principles exceed definability thresholds.
\end{itemize}

Under current empirical conditions, the observed universe supports a
robust \(K_{11}\) meta-theoretical continuum: mathematical,
computational and physical frameworks remain globally coherent,
providing the structural foundation for the semantic level \(K_{12}\).
