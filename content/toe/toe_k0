\subsection{Level \(K_0\): structural conditions for any universe}
\label{subsec:toe-k0}

At level \(K_0\) the ontology does not speak about particular fields,
particles or spacetimes. Instead, it specifies what it means for
\emph{any} universe-like continuum to exist at all: there must be a
non-empty space of admissible states \(\Omega(K_0)\), a family of
differences that can be organised into axes, and at least one
non-trivial cycle of structural updates.

For the observed universe we assume:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a non-empty domain of possible configurations
          \(\mathcal{C}_\mathrm{univ}\);
    \item a measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathcal{C}_\mathrm{univ}\) such that
          admissible states form a measurable subset
          \(\Omega(K_0)\subseteq\mathcal{C}_\mathrm{univ}\);
    \item a hierarchy of difference-classes that can in principle give
          rise to the axes realised at \(K_1\)–\(K_2\).
\end{itemize}

We do not attach numerical values to \(K_0\) itself, but we require
that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the measure of admissible states \(\mu(\Omega(K_0))\) is
          strictly positive;
    \item the degrees of freedom at later levels satisfy the general
          constraint \( \mathrm{DoF}(K_x) \le \mathrm{DoF}(M_x)\), where
          \(M_x\) are the corresponding meta-spaces defined in the core
          model.
\end{enumerate}

In this sense, the observed universe is treated as one concrete
realisation of a logical meta-domain that satisfies the axioms of
\(K_0\), without imposing further metaphysical assumptions.
