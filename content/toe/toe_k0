\subsection{Level \(K_0\): structural conditions for any universe}
\label{subsec:toe-k0}

Level \(K_0\) does not describe fields, particles, geometry or dynamics.
It specifies the minimal structural conditions under which any 
universe-like continuum can exist at all. 
These conditions precede the emergence of axes, potentials, thresholds 
and the higher-level continua \(K_1\)–\(K_{12}\). 
In the terminology of the core model, \(K_0\) provides the 
logical meta-domain that makes later levels possible.

For the observed universe we assume that the following structural 
requirements are satisfied:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a non-empty configuration space 
          \(\mathcal{C}_\mathrm{univ}\) of logically admissible states;
    \item a measure \(\mu\) defined on \(\mathcal{C}_\mathrm{univ}\),
          such that the admissible subset 
          \(\Omega(K_0)\subseteq\mathcal{C}_\mathrm{univ}\) is measurable;
    \item a family of distinguishable differences capable of supporting
          axes in higher continua, i.e.\ the precursor structure from
          which \(A_1, A_2, \dots\) can arise under the operator
          \(\Psi_{0\to1}\).
\end{itemize}

We do not assign numerical values at this level. 
Instead, we specify the general constraints that the observed universe 
must satisfy in order to be representable as a continuum compatible
with the core axioms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Non-degeneracy of admissible states:}  
          the measure of admissible configurations must be strictly 
          positive,
          \[
              \mu(\Omega(K_0)) > 0.
          \]
          A continuum with \(\mu(\Omega(K_0))=0\) is structurally empty
          and cannot give rise to higher levels.

    \item \textbf{Compatibility with meta-spaces:}  
          for every higher level \(K_x\), the degrees of freedom satisfy
          \[
              \mathrm{DoF}(K_x) \leq \mathrm{DoF}(M_x),
          \]
          where \(M_x\) is the corresponding meta-space defined in the
          core model.  
          This ensures that all later continua are internally bounded by 
          the expressive capacity of their meta-levels.

    \item \textbf{Existence of at least one non-trivial cycle:}  
          the structural update cycle \(C_{\mathrm{triv}}\) must be 
          present, guaranteeing that the continuum is not static but 
          capable of supporting transitions within  
          \(\Omega(K_0)\).
\end{enumerate}

Within this framework the observed universe is treated as a single,
concrete realisation of a \(K_0\)-compatible meta-domain. 
No additional metaphysical assumptions are imposed. 
The only requirement is that its subsequent continua \(K_1\)–\(K_{12}\) 
can be consistently generated from these structural preconditions.
