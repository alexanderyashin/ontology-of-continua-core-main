\subsection{Level \(K_2\): fields, phases and large-scale structure}
\label{subsec:toe-k2}

At level \(K_2\) we represent the observed universe in terms of
classical and quantum fields, phase structure and effective
thermodynamic parameters. The axes \(A^{(2)}\) for the observed
universe include, at minimum:
\begin{itemize}
    \item field configuration axes for the metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\),
          gauge fields and matter fields;
    \item axes for energy density components \(\rho_i\) and their
          relative fractions \(\Omega_i\);
    \item an axis for the order parameters of relevant phases
          (e.g.\ symmetry-breaking scales, confinement/deconfinement
          regimes);
    \item an axis for curvature and expansion rate (effective Hubble
          parameter \(H\)).
\end{itemize}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(2)}\) are given by:
\begin{align}
    P^{(2)}_\mathrm{energy} &= \{\rho_\mathrm{m},\,\rho_\mathrm{r},\,\rho_\Lambda,\ldots\},\\
    P^{(2)}_\mathrm{geometry} &= \{k,\,H,\,R,\,\Lambda_\mathrm{eff}\},\\
    P^{(2)}_\mathrm{phase} &= \{\phi_\mathrm{SB},\,T_c^{\mathrm{QCD}},\,T_c^{\mathrm{EW}},\ldots\}.
\end{align}

For the observed universe, these quantities are specified numerically
in Table~\ref{tab:toe-k2-cosmological-parameters}. We only require
here that they lie within the admissible ranges that keep the universe
inside \(\Omega(K_2)\): the expansion history must avoid both trivial
recollapse and immediate dispersion, and the phase structure must
permit the emergence of the chemical and biological regimes
\(K_3\)–\(K_5\).

Flows \(J^{(2)}\) correspond to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item cosmological expansion and redshift of radiation;
    \item energy exchange between matter, radiation and vacuum-like
          components at early times;
    \item phase transitions that reconfigure the effective degrees of
          freedom and thresholds at lower levels.
\end{itemize}

The thresholds \(\Theta^{(2)}\) for the observed universe include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item critical temperatures \(T_c\) for known phase transitions;
    \item bounds on curvature and expansion rate that keep the
          large-scale continuum in a regime where \(\Omega(K_2)\) is
          non-empty and connected;
    \item bounds on fluctuations that allow percolation structures
          (galaxies, clusters) without destroying global stability.
\end{itemize}

In this way \(K_2\) for the observed universe is specified by a finite
set of measured parameters together with structural constraints that
ensure compatibility with the higher-level continua.
