\subsection{Level \(K_2\): fields, phases and large-scale structure}
\label{subsec:toe-k2}

Level \(K_2\) represents the observed universe in terms of classical and 
quantum fields, effective large-scale geometry and phase structure. 
While \(K_1\) introduces resolvable energetic distinctions and a temporal 
update axis, \(K_2\) provides the first continuum where field equations, 
phase transitions and large-scale thermodynamic parameters can be defined 
consistently.

In the observed universe the axes \(A^{(2)}\) include, at minimum:
\begin{itemize}
    \item axes for the configuration space of the metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\),
          gauge fields and matter fields;
    \item axes for energy density components \(\rho_i\) and their 
          relative fractions \(\Omega_i\) (matter, radiation, 
          vacuum-like contributions);
    \item axes for order parameters of relevant phases 
          (e.g.\ confinement/deconfinement, symmetry breaking scales);
    \item an axis for curvature and expansion history, expressed by the 
          effective Hubble parameter \(H\) and curvature \(k\).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Potentials.}

The corresponding potentials \(P^{(2)}\) relevant for the observed universe are:
\begin{align}
    P^{(2)}_\mathrm{energy} &= 
        \{\rho_\mathrm{m},\,\rho_\mathrm{r},\,\rho_\Lambda,\,\dots\},\\
    P^{(2)}_\mathrm{geometry} &= 
        \{k,\,H,\,R,\,\Lambda_\mathrm{eff}\},\\
    P^{(2)}_\mathrm{phase} &= 
        \{\phi_\mathrm{SB},\,T_c^{\mathrm{QCD}},\,T_c^{\mathrm{EW}},\,\dots\}.
\end{align}

All numerical values used in this level are summarised in 
Table~\ref{tab:toe-k2-cosmological-parameters} of the appendix. 
We require here only that the measured values of the observed universe 
lie within the admissible ranges that keep the continuum inside 
\(\Omega(K_2)\).

\paragraph{Admissible states and thresholds.}

The region \(\Omega(K_2)\) is defined by structural thresholds 
\(\Theta^{(2)}\) ensuring that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the expansion history does not enter immediate recollapse nor 
          unbounded dispersion,
          \[
              0 < H(t) < H_{\max}(\Theta^{(2)}_\mathrm{geom});
          \]
    \item phase transitions occur within empirically known windows,
          \[
              T(t) = T_c^\mathrm{QCD},\; T_c^\mathrm{EW}, \dots
          \]
          with critical thresholds matched to observed particle spectra;
    \item curvature remains within a regime where global connectivity of
          \(\Omega(K_2)\) is preserved,
          \[
              |k| < \Theta^{(2)}_k;
          \]
    \item fluctuations of matter and radiation allow the formation of 
          percolation structures (galaxies, clusters) without destroying 
          large-scale stability.
\end{enumerate}

In physical terms, these conditions correspond to the well-established 
parameter ranges of modern cosmology (flatness bounds, matter–radiation 
ratios, and the values of critical temperatures for known symmetry-breaking 
events). They guarantee that the universe remains within a dynamically 
admissible region compatible with subsequent continua \(K_3\)–\(K_5\).

\paragraph{Flows and cycles.}

The key flows \(J^{(2)}\) governing the dynamics at this level are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item cosmological expansion and redshift of radiation,  
          \[
              J_\mathrm{exp}: a(t) \rightarrow a(t+\Delta t),
          \]
          which regulates energy densities and drives thermal evolution;
    \item early-time energy exchange between matter, radiation and 
          vacuum-like components, shaping the approach to observed values 
          of \(\Omega_\mathrm{m}, \Omega_\mathrm{r}, \Omega_\Lambda\);
    \item phase transitions that reconfigure effective degrees of freedom,
          reducing or increasing the accessible configuration space and 
          inducing new thresholds at lower levels.
\end{itemize}

A stabilising cycle \(C^{(2)}\) consists of the interplay between 
expansion, cooling and field reconfiguration. The universe exits 
\(\Omega(K_2)\) only in collapse scenarios such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(H \rightarrow 0\) with sufficient density for recollapse;
    \item rapid curvature growth violating \(|k| < \Theta^{(2)}_k\);
    \item fluctuations that eliminate large-scale connectivity;
    \item failure of phase transitions to produce the chemical and 
          biochemical regimes required for \(K_3\)–\(K_5\).
\end{itemize}

Under the measured parameters of our universe, none of these collapse 
modes are realised within the observable window. 
Thus \(K_2\) is fully instantiated by a finite and well-measured set of 
cosmological quantities, consistently satisfying the structural 
constraints of the continuum.
