% Dummy section recreated for Core 1.1 — extended boundary / patch geometry

\section{Extended Boundary and Patch Geometry}
\label{sec:boundary-extended}

% TODO: migrate and expand content on boundaries from Core~1.0 / Core~2.x.
% Scope:
%   - Formal properties of \partial\Omega(K) beyond the minimal definition
%     in the main model section.
%   - Patch-based representation of boundaries (local patches, states, and
%     thresholds on each patch).
%   - Examples from K_2--K_5 (phase interfaces, membranes, vesicles, etc.).
%
% Suggested internal structure:
%   1) Geometric and topological structure of \partial\Omega(K).
%   2) Patch model for boundaries (\partial\Omega as a union of patches).
%   3) Local threshold landscapes on patches (Θ_mem_i, Θ_grad_i, …).
%   4) Patch dynamics (flicker, leak, burst regimes).
%   5) Role of boundary geometry in birth, life and death of continua.
