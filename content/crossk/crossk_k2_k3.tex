\subsection{K2 K3 cross-level structure}
\label{sec:crossk-k2-k3}

% TODO: Describe the cross-level structure, thresholds, and operators
%       relevant to this K-level combination.
%
% Suggested outline:
%   1. Levels involved and their roles
%   2. Shared / inherited axes and thresholds
%   3. Cross-level flows (J), cycles (C), and tensions (T)
%   4. Birth / death conditions across the levels
%   5. Empirical or conceptual examples
