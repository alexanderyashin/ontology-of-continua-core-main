% Dummy section recreated for Core 1.1 — collapse and attempted rebirth

\section{Collapse and Attempted Rebirth of Continua}
\label{sec:collapse-rebirth}

% TODO: migrate the extended treatment of collapse dynamics and "rebirth"
% scenarios from Core~1.0 / later runs.
%
% Scope:
%   - Structural characterisation of collapse (Ω = ∅, k -> 0, loss of cycles).
%   - Role of embedding spaces M in forced collapse.
%   - Distinction between true rebirth (new continuum K') and continuation.
%
% Suggested internal structure:
%   1) Formal criteria for collapse (equivalent formulations).
%   2) Collapse driven by internal vs external (embedding) constraints.
%   3) Dynamics near collapse thresholds (approach, critical slowing, breakdown).
%   4) Post-collapse configurations and possibility of new continua K'.
%   5) Examples across K_3–K_5 (e.g. protocell rupture, network failure).
